#Note that this works a little different than you might be
#used to: The remainder is always given as positive, as per
#the modulus operator. This is meaningless if the divisor is
#negative, but correct if only the dividend is negative.
#Also,
#The quotient is always rounded towards 0, instead of "down".
#I think.
