#to call Mult4 as signed multiplication:

MOVADDR Return INTO Mult4_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
JMP Mult4_SignedEntry

#to call Mult4 as unsigned multiplication:

MOV $Op2 INTO Mult4_Op2[1]
MOVADDR Return INTO Mult4_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
STR Mult4_Op1[0]

#to call Mult4 as unsafe 8-bit multiplication:

JMP Mult4_8Entry
Return:

#8-bit answer is now in Mult4_Ans.
#The answer will be determined according
#to the same signedness as the call.
#If you only want a 4-bit answer, 
#look in Mult4_Ans[1]
