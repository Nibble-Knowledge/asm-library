#This function can be called three ways:
#	-signed 16-bit multiplication
#	-unsigned 16-bit multiplication
#	-unsafe 32-bit multiplication

#to call Mult16 as signed multiplication:

MOV16 $Op1 INTO Mult16_Op1
MOV16 $Op2 INTO Mult16_Op2
MOVADDR Return INTO Mult16_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
JMP Mult16_SignedEntry
Return:
NOP 0

#to call Mult16 as unsigned multiplication:

MOV16 $Op1 INTO Mult16_Op1
MOV16 $Op2 INTO Mult16_Op2
MOVADDR Return INTO Mult16_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
STR Mult16_Op1Ex
STR Mult16_Op2Ex
JMP Mult16_UnsignedEntry
Return:
NOP 0

#to call Mult16 as overflow-unsafe sign-agnostic
#32-bit multiplication (slightly faster than mult32):

MOV32 $Op1 INTO Mult16_1full
MOV32 $Op2 INTO Mult16_2full
MOVADDR Return INTO Mult16_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
JMP Mult16_32Entry
Return:
NOP 0


#32-bit answer is now in Mult16_Ans.
#The answer will be determined according
#to the same signedness as the call.
#If you only want a 16-bit answer, 
#look in Mult16_Ans[4]
