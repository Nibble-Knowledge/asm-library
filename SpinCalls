#How to call Spin.s
#Note: Unlike practically all the other asm-library
#functions, you can trust this one to have good initialised
#variables, since it only returns if Spin_Count == 0.
#It supports any number of cycles up to 2^64 - 1.
#Just MOV in an appropriate number and continue

#You usually only need to edit one nibble of Spin_Count
#Changing the offset is the thing that really changes the
#spin time


MOV N_[1] INTO Spin_Count[5]
MOVADDR SpinCall_Return INTO Spin_Return[1]
