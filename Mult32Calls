#This function can be called three ways:
#	-signed 32-bit multiplication
#	-unsigned 32-bit multiplication
#	-unsafe 64-bit multiplication

#to call Mult32 as signed 32 multiplication:

MOV32 $Op1 INTO Mult32_Op1
MOV32 $Op2 INTO Mult32_Op2
MOVADDR Return INTO Mult32_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
JMP Mult32_SignedEntry
Return:
NOP 0

#to call Mult32 as unsigned 32 multiplication:

MOV32 $Op1 INTO Mult32_Op1
MOV32 $Op2 INTO Mult32_Op2
MOVADDR Return INTO Mult32_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
STR Mult32_Op1Ex
STR Mult32_Op2Ex
JMP Mult32_UnsignedEntry
Return:
NOP 0

#to call Mult32 as (sign-agnostic) 64-bit multiplication:

MOV64 $Op1 INTO Mult32_1full
MOV64 $Op2 INTO Mult32_2full
MOVADDR Return INTO Mult32_RetAddr[1]
LOD N_[0]
JMP Mult32_64Entry
Return:
NOP 0

#64-bit answer is now in Mult32_Ans.
#The answer will be determined according
#to the same signedness as the call.
#If you only want a 32-bit answer, 
#look in Mult32_Ans[8]
